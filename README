JMAPI 1.0.0

JMAPI is a simple Java library for opening mail messages using MAPI
(which should use the user's preferred mailer). 

The project was carved from the ashes of the JDesktop Integration
Components project (JDIC) (http://java.net/projects/jdic/) as JDIC
cannot be easily used within an OSGi bundle.  Much of the remaining
functionality within JDIC has been absorbed into Java6 through
java.awt.Desktop.

JMAPI can likely still be be used from plain Java jars, but your
code will require loading the accompanying DLL; you might prefer
to use JDIC directly.

Currently only Windows 32-bit platforms are supported. 

As with JDIC, JMAPI is licensed under the LGPL.
